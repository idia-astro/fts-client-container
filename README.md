# FTS client tools

This container was created as there were problems getting the FTS client tools
to install on CentOS.

It's the FTS3 REST command line tools installed herein and documentation for these tools can be found [here](http://fts3-docs.web.cern.ch/fts3-docs/fts-rest/docs/cli/index.html).

The configuration for the (not production-grade) IDIA CA is also installed.
